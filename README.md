## Hello there im Aj 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on creating a simple to use but intuitive scheduling app that encompasses both web and mobile.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, bash, and TypeScript.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Hackathons, UI/UX design for my project, or beginner C/systems projects.
- ⚡ Fun fact: It took me 4 tries to finish level 8 swim lessons.
